# VC2022

A simple traffic sign detection and classification project that uses classic
Image Processing methods. Developed in the context of the C.U. V.C.

## Code

The frs.py is an fast radial symetry implementation in python, found
[here](https://github.com/ChristianGutowski/frst_python), which was adapted by
the group to serve our needs. The notebook contains the entire identification
process.

## Images

The used dataset can be found in kaggle
[Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/road-sign-detection). For the
notebook to run, the dataset must be extracted to the dataset/ directory.

Any extra images need to be placed within the dataset/images/ directory, and the
notebook function evaluateImage must be called with the desired image name
